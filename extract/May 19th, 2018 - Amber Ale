### Brewing Notes - May 19th, 2018

# Amber Ale

## Notes:
- Intentionally underpitched, probably bad idea - stressed yeast
- Possibly over-oxygenated; try to give a few good pumbs and call it good. 
- Might due well to cool further, say 70˚ at least
- 1332 notorious for unfallen krausen, yeast rafts
- OG 1.048 (low, likely due to mishandling DME), FG {}

## Malt:
- 2.75lb Golden Light DME @ front
- 2.75lb Golden Light DME @ knockout
- 12oz Crystal 40˚L
- 4oz Carapils
- Steep @ 160-165˚ for 24 min

## Hops:
- .5oz Centennial 9.9%a @ 60
- 1oz Mt. Hood 5.5%a @ 30
- 1oz Willamette 4.6%a @ 15

## Yeast:
- Wyeast 1332 - Northwest Ale
- 1 packet

# Other:
- 1/2 tsp Irish moss @ 15
- 1/2 tsp yeast nutrients

Log:
- 5/19/2018 Brewed, bucketed;
- 5/27/2018 still noticeably bubbling
  - smells like... something. sweet? banana? decay???
  - still a krausen, though most has fallen
