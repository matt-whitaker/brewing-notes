### Malt Notes:
- Ask about hop adjustments for partial boils if all extract is up front
  - Just makes the end of the boil a "thing"
- Steep is more difficult on flame so consider, even if "specialty", using an insulated "mash" ton 
- Extract calculations go wonky, consider a bit more preparation.
