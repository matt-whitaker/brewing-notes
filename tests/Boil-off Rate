# Boil-off Rate

## Start

1. 7 Gallons ~60˚ to start (hose water)
2. ~1hr to bring to boild
3. Clock start at 212˚, when rolls form

## End

- ~5.5-5.6 Gallons 
- Boil-off 1.4-1.5gph (gallons per hour)

## Notes

- Effectively perpendicular state of gas regulator (identified by fairly vigorous flame, but too high is also fairly obvious)
- Aim for 6.5 boil volume
