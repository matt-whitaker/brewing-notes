Log:
- 4/21/18 Brewed, bucketed; ~4-5days before bubbling becomes unnoticeable. 
- 5/12/18 Kegged; 35 psi, shaken periodically for a couple hours, disconnected and rest overnight, set at 10psi for 4 days
- 5/17/18 Green has started to fade
- 5/26/18 Green is gone, actually tastes pretty good!
  - Not a hop bomb, but clearly Cascade, grows over time leaves a nice bitter residue on lips
  - Nice, mellow alcohol punch, not terribly syrupy
