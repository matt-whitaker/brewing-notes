### Brewing Notes - May 19th, 2018

# Big Basin Amber Ale ✅

## Notes:
- Intentionally underpitched, probably bad idea - stressed yeast
- Possibly over-oxygenated; try to give a few good pumbs and call it good. 
- After boil, might due well to cool further, say 70˚ at least
- 1332 notorious for unfallen krausen, yeast rafts
- OG 1.048 (low, likely due to mishandling DME), FG 1.012
- Tasting Notes
  - Note: Light yeast smell, hint of fruity esters from 1332
  - Front: Lightly sweet, extract-y, hint of biscuit, nice easy bitter
  - Back: Spicy, lightly juicy, more biscuit
- Revist as BIAB
- Flaked wheat = huge impact on mouth feel and flavor

## Malt:
- 2.75lb Golden Light DME @ front
- 2.75lb Golden Light DME @ knockout
- 2lb Crystal 40˚L
- .5lb Flaked Wheat
- Steep @ 160-165˚ for 24 min

## Hops:
- .5oz Centennial 9.9%a @ 60
- 1oz Mt. Hood 5.5%a @ 30
- 1oz Willamette 4.6%a @ 15

## Yeast:
- Wyeast 1332 - Northwest Ale
- 1 packet

Log:
- 5/19/2018 Brewed, bucketed;
- 5/27/2018 still noticeably bubbling
  - smells like... something. sweet? banana? decay???
  - still a krausen, though most has fallen
- 6/1/2018 smell seems to have lessened, more like muffins now?
- 6/6/2018 racked to secondary, note at this time krausen has completely fallen
  - Smell is gone, tastes sweet(ish) and malty
  - Hard to identify hops at this time
- 6/15/2018 kegged; left way too much starsan in keg when racking, made it very difficult to tell beer level, foam level was at gas diptube which caused foam to come out when burping, and some evidence of beer in it. Nothing in gas line, but next time clear foam. 
- 6/16/2018 - NOTE: SET AT SERV PRESSURE, MIND THE FOAM!
- 6/30/2018 -
