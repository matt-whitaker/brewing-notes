### Brewing Notes - April 21st, 2019

# Porter

## Obvious Adjustments
- Yeast (Imperial's "Darkness"
- Amber LME instead of DME
- Second addition at 15 instead of 5
- Steeping

## Notes:
- OG ~1.060, FG 1.018
- Tasting:
  - Pre-carb: darkness "irish" yeast definitely coming through. comes across smooth. nice sweetness with roasty/cocoa flavor still present.

## Malt:

### Extract
- 2.65lb (ish) Sparkling Amber LME @ front
- 2.65lb (ish) Pilsen Light LME @ front
- 3.25lb (ish) Pilsen Light LME @ 15 (to give chance to heat back up)

### Specialty
- 1lb Crystal 40˚L
- 12oz Chocolate
- 8oz Black Patent
- Steep @ 155˚ for 30 min
  1. Rise to ~155˚-160˚
  2. Turn off burner, or set very low
  3. Set lid
  4. Watch temp, apply heat if needed
    
### Malt Notes:
- Ask about hop adjustments for partial boils if all extract is up front
  - Just makes the end of the boil a "thing"
- Steep is more difficult on flame so consider, even if "specialty", using an insulated "mash" ton 
- Extract calculations go wonky, consider a bit more preparation.
